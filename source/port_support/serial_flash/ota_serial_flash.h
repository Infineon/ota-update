/***********************************************************************************************//**
 * \file ota_serial_flash.h
 *
 * \brief
 * Provides APIs for OTA interaction with an external flash connected to the SPI or
 * QSPI interface. All functions are implemented as blocking functions.
 *
 * This is a mid-layer API to sit between OTA functions and PDL functions for serial flash access.
 *
 * We also handle cases for XIP code. This code (and lower-level code) will be placed in RAM
 * so that they can access external flash.
 *
 * This code MUST be executed from RAM.
 * 1 - Critical section is Entered (if necessary, state saved)
 * 2 - XIP is turned off (if active, state saved)
 *     - XIP Cache is cleared and turned off
 * 3 - SMIF is initialized (as needed)
 * 4 - Read/write/size inquiries are completed
 * 5 - SMIF is de-initialized
 * 6 - XIP Cache is re-enabled (if it was disabled)
 * 8 - XIP is re-enabled (if it was disabled)
 * 9 - Critical section is exited (if it was Entered)
 *
