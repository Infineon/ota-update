# Over-the-Air (OTA) Update Middleware Library

The OTA library provides support for Over-The-Air update of the application code running on an Infineon device.
Supported devices:
- PSoC™ 6 MCU with
  - AIROC™ CYW4343W
  - CYW43012 Wi-Fi & Bluetooth® combo chip
- CYW920829M2EVB-01 evaluation board.
- CY8CKIT-062-BLE
- CY8CPROTO-063-BLE
- CYBLE-416045-EVAL

For devices with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® Interfaces, the device can use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth® Interfaces.

For <b>WiFi</b>, the OTA library utilizes MQTT or HTTP and TLS to securely connect to an MQTT Broker/HTTP server to download and update the user application.

For <b>Bluetooth®</b>, the OTA library works with an intermediate peer application on a laptop (or phone) to push the image to the device.

## Library Versions
ota-update v2.0.0 works with ModusToolbox 3.0 and is <b>not</b> backwards compatible with ModusToolbox 2.4.

ota-update v1.0.0 works with ModusToolbox 2.4 and replaces anycloud-ota (all versions).

The anycloud-ota vx.x.x library will be depricated soon.

## 1. OTA Updating uses MCUBootApp

The OTA library works in concert with MCUBootApp to provide a no-fail solution to updating device software in the field.

MCUBootApp is a separate application that is built outside of your application. It is programmed separately to the device and is not updated for the life of the device.

Your application will include the ota-update library, which will set the appropriate flags so that MCUBootApp knows when to perform an update of your application. The OTA library will download a new (updated) application, store it in flash, and set flags so that on the next reset, MCUBootApp will see there is an update available.

<b>The basic device boot sequence is as follows:</b>

1. ROM boot will start MCUBootApp
2. If no update is downloaded, MCUBootApp starts the current application.
3. MCUBootApp determines if there is an update in the Secondary Slot
4. If there is an update available:<br>
   a. MCUBootApp verifies the update.<br>
   b. MCUBootApp SWAPs (or OVERWRITEs) the current with the update applications.<br>
   c. MCUBootApp starts the new (updated) application.<br>
   d. The updated application must call cy_ota_storage_validated() to validate the update.<br>
   e. For SWAP, if the new application does not call cy_ota_storage_validated(), MCUBootApp will REVERT on the next reset.<br>

<b>NOTE:</b> On secure MCUs such as 064, MCUBootApp is flashed as part of the provisioning step performed by the provisioning tools, and does not need to be built separately. For more info see [MCUBootApp Information](./OTA_MCUBOOTAPP_README.md) section "5. cysecuretools for CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W".<br><br>

<b>1.1 Flash layout requirements</b><br>

MCUBootApp and the OTA enabled application must use the same flash layout.

The flash is separated into sections also called slots. The current application occupies the Primary (boot) Slot. The update application (new version) will be downloaded into the Secondary (upgrade) Slot.

Besides primary and secondary slots, MCUBootApp has a code section, a section for a "Swap Buffer" and a section for "Status Info".

| Section         | Size                 | Description                |
|-----------------| ---------------------|----------------------------|
| MCUBootApp      | 0x00018000           | MCUBootApp code            |
| Primary Slot    | Varies by flash size | User Application (current) |
| Secondary Slot  | Same size as Primary | Update Application (new)   |
| Swap Buffer     | Varies by flash size | Used by MCUBootApp for SWAP operation |
| Status          | Varies by size of Slots | Used by MCUBootApp for update status |

For more information, please see \<ota-update\>/OTA_FLASH_LAYOUT_README.md.<br><br>

<b>1.2 MCUBootApp Cloning and Building</b><br>

MCUBootApp is a standalone application that runs on CM0+ core. It is open source software taken and customized in terms of Flash map and is built outside of ModusToolbox. MCUBootApp is programmed/flashed on the device one time, at manufacture (or for development).

MCUBoot itself is not OTA upgradable.

For more information, please see \<ota-update\>/OTA_MCUBOOTAPP_README.md.

<b>1.3 Target and Flashmap Use</b><br>

## 2. Enabling OTA in an Application

An application that is OTA Enabled runs on CM4. This application is built in ModusToolbox, incorporating the OTA library and making initialization calls to start the OTA process.

On a virgin device, main application is programmed / flashed to the device first time. Subsequent versions of the application (so called updates) are downloaded and upgraded using OTA.

On some devices such as 064 kits, there will be multiple images such as main application and the TFM images that are OTA updatable. This OTA solution allows using TAR format package for updating a single, or multiple images.

The ModusToolbox OTA code examples import the ota-update library automatically.

For more information, please see \<ota-update\>/OTA_MAKEFILE_INFO_README.md.


## 3. Pull Model Updates

<b>WiFi</b> updates use a "Pull" model. There are two WiFi "Update Flows" that a user can designate. HTTP and MQTT transports can be used for this type of update.<br>
<b>Bluetooth®</b> updates use a "Push" model. See section 4 below.<br><br>

<b>3.1. Direct Flow</b><br>
With "Direct" flow approach, device downloads a known file from the server/broker.

a. HTTP: The device connects to the known HTTP Server and downloads the OTA update image using HTTP `GET` requests, asking for a range of data sequentially until all data is transferred.

b. MQTT: The device connects to the known MQTT Broker topic and publishes a "Request Download" message with a "Unique Topic Name" to the Publisher. The Publisher python application then splits the OTA update image into chunks and publishes them on the unique topic.<br>

<b>3.2. Job Flow</b><br>
With a "Job" flow approach, the device downloads a JSON formatted job document that provides information about where the update file is, its version, and other information concerning the update.

a. The device connects to the server/broker to obtain the Job document.
- HTTP: The device connects to the known HTTP server and uses an HTTP `GET` request to obtain the Job document.
- MQTT: The device subscribes to the known MQTT Broker topic and publishes a request for the Job document.

b. The device uses the Job document to determine if the OTA update image is an appropriate update.

c. The device connects to the data server/broker and downloads the OTa image.
- HTTP: The image is downloaded using HTTP `GET` requests, asking for a range of data sequentially until all data is transferred.
- MQTT: The device sends a "Request Download" message with the "Unique Topic Name" on the known topic. The puthon Publisher application then splits the OTA image into chunks and publishes them on the unique topic.



## 4. Push Model Updates

<b>Bluetooth®</b> updates use a "Push" model. On reset / boot, the device advertises that it can handle an update, and a Host (laptop, phone, etc.) is used to connect and "Push" the update to the device.

## 5. OTA Library Features and Functionality

The "cy_ota_config.h" file provides configuration options to adjust multiple timing values to customize how often to check for updates, and other parameters for the MQTT Broker/HTTP Server connection. Copy the configuration file "\<ota-update library\>configs/cy_ota_config.h" file to the directory where your application Makefile is, and adjust as needed.

- The OTA Agent runs in a separate background thread, only connecting to MQTT Broker/HTTP server based on the timing configuration. For Bluetooth® operation, the OTA library starts the Bluetooth® module and starts advertising.

- Parameters such as MQTT Broker/HTTP server and credentials are passed into `cy_ota_agent_start()`.

- The OTA Agent provides a callback mechanism to report stages of connect, download percentage, and errors. The application can override the default OTA Agent behavior for each step, or stop the current download during the callback.

Once the application starts the OTA agent, the OTA agent will contact the MQTT Broker/HTTP server at the defined intervals to check whether an update is available. If available, the update will be downloaded. If the `reset_after_complete` flag was set in the agent parameters, the OTA Agent will automatically reset the device. On the next system reset, MCUBootApp will perform the update.

## 6. Example Job Flow Update Sequence Using HTTP

1. The device connects to the HTTP server and uses the HTTP `GET` request to obtain the Job document (for example: *ota_update.json*).

2. The device determines whether the OTA update image version is newer than the currently executing application, and the board name is the same, etc.

   - If the OTA update image is accessible through an MQTT Broker, the device creates and subscribes to a unique topic name and sends a "Request Download" message with the "Unique Topic Name" to the Publisher on the known topic `OTAUpdate/CY8CPROTO_062_4343W/notify_publisher`. The Publisher then splits the OTA update image into chunks and publishes them on the unique topic.

   - If the OTA update image is accessible on an HTTP Server, the device connects to the HTTP Server and downloads the OTA update image using an HTTP `GET` request, asking for a range of data sequentially until all data is transferred.

For Job document information, please see Job Document section below.

## 7. Example Job Flow Update Sequence Using MQTT

1. The Publisher Python script (*libs/ota-update/scripts/publisher.py*) subscribes to a known topic (for example: *OTAUpdate/CY8CPROTO_062_4343W/publish_notify*) on the specified MQTT Broker.

2. The device publishes the message "Update Availability" to the known topic. The message includes information about the device (manufacturer, product, serial number, application version, etc.), and a "Unique Topic Name" for the Publisher to send messages to the device.

3. The Publisher receives the "Update Availability" message and publishes the appropriate Job document on the "Unique Topic Name". The Publisher can make a decision if there is an appropriate update available for the device. The Publisher sends an "Update Available" (or "No Update Available") message, which repeats the device-specific information.

4. The device receives the Job document and connects to the Broker/server given in the Job document to obtain the OTA update image.

    - If the OTA update image is located on an MQTT Broker, the device connects and sends a "Request Update" message to the Publisher, which includes the device information again. The Publisher then splits the OTA update image into 4-kB chunks, adds a header to each chunk, and sends it to the device on the "Unique Topic Name".

    - If the OTA update image is located on an HTTP server, the device will connect to the HTTP server and download the OTA update image using an HTTP `GET` request, for a range of data sequentially until all data is transferred.

For Job document information, please see Job Document section below.


## 8. The Pull Model Job Document

The Job document is a JSON-formatted file that contains fields used to communicate between the Publisher script and the OTA Agent running on the device.

```
Manufacturer:   Manufacturer Name.
ManufacturerId: Manufacturer Identifier
Product:        Product Name.
SerialNumber:   The Devices unique Serial Number
Version:        Application version Major.Minor.Build (ex: "12.15.0")
Board:          Name of board used for the product. (ex: "CY8CPROTO_062_4343W")
Connection:     The type of Connection to access the OTA Image. ("MQTT", "HTTP", "HTTPS")
Port:           Port number for accessing the OTA Image. (ex: `MQTT:1883`, HTTP:80`)
```

<b>Additional fields for HTTP Transport Type:</b>

```
Server:         Server URL (ex: "http://ota_images.my_server.com")
File:           Name of the OTA Image file (ex: "<product>_<board>_v5.6.0.bin")
Offset:         Offset in bytes for the start of data to transfer.
Size:           The size of the chunk of data to send, in bytes.
```

The following is an example Job document for an OTA update image that is available on an HTTP server:

```
{
  "Manufacturer":"Express Widgits Corporation",
  "ManufacturerId":"EWCO",
  "Product":"Easy Widgit",
  "SerialNumber":"ABC213450001",
  "Version":"1.76.0",
  "Board":"CY8CPROTO_062_4343W",
  "Connection":"HTTP",
  "Server":"<server_URL>",
  "Port":"80",
  "File":"/<OTA_image_file_name>"
}
```

<b>Additional fields for MQTT Transport Type:</b>

```
Broker:          MQTT Broker to access the OTA update image (for example: `mqtt.my_broker.com`)
UniqueTopicName: The "replace" value is just a placeholder. It is replaced with the Unique Topic Name for the OTA data transfer.
```

The following is an example Job document for an OTA update image that is available on an MQTT Broker:

```
{
  "Manufacturer":"Express Widgits Corporation",
  "ManufacturerId":"EWCO",
  "Product":"Easy Widgit",
  "SerialNumber":"ABC213450001",
  "Version":"1.2.28",
  "Board":"CY8CPROTO_062_4343W",
  "Connection":"MQTT",
  "Broker":"mqtt.widgitcorp.com",
  "Port":"1883",
  "UniqueTopicName":"replace"
}
```

## 9. Setting Up the Supplied Publisher Python Script for MQTT Updates

The *libs/ota-update/scripts/publisher.py* script contains several configurable values. Ensure that the parameters in the script match the application values. In addition, check the example application you are using for any special needs.

The Publisher and Subscriber scripts require an additional Python module.

```
pip install paho-mqtt
```

Using the publisher script to test MQTT updates:

```
cd libs/ota-update/scripts
python publisher.py [tls] [-l] [-f <filepath>] [-b <broker>] [-k <kit>] [-c <company_topic>]
```

Usage:

- `tls` - Add this argument to run the Publisher with TLS (secure sockets). You must also supply the appropriate certificates and keys.

- `-l` - Output more logging information to debug connection issues.

- `-f <filepath>` -Use this argument to designate the name of the downloaded file.

- `-b <broker>` - Use this argument to override the default broker.  Note that you will need to add the certificates for TLS usage. The files must reside in the same directory as the *subscriber.py* script.

  - `amazon`

    - Change the `AMAZON_BROKER_ADDRESS` endpoint in the *publisher.py* script.

         ```
         AMAZON_BROKER_ADDRESS = "<endpoint>.iot.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"
         ```

    - Add the following certificate files:

      ```
      ca_certs = "amazon_ca.crt"
      certfile = "amazon_client.crt"
      keyfile  = "amazon_private_key.pem"
      ```

  - `eclipse` ( broker: `mqtt.eclipseprojects.io`)

    - Add the following certificate files:

      ```
      ca_certs = "eclipse_ca.crt"
      certfile = "eclipse_client.crt"
      keyfile  = "eclipse_client.pem"
      ```
  - `mosquitto` (broker: `test.mosquitto.org`)

    - Add the following certificate files:

      ```
      ca_certs = "mosquitto.org.crt"
      certfile = "mosquitto_client.crt"
      keyfile  = "mosquitto_client.key"
      ```

- `-k <kit>` - Use this argument to override the default kit (CY8CPROTO_062_4343W).

  The kit name is used as part of the topic name; it must match the kit you are using, be sure to replace '-' (dash) with '_' (underscore).

- `-c <company_topic>` - Add this to the first part of the topic path names.

  Company topic default is "OTAUpdate".

  This must also be mirrored in the application for the topic name. This allows for multiple devices being tested to simultaneously connect to different instances of the  Publisher running on different systems so that they do not interfere with each other.

## 10. Using the Subscriber Python Script for testing MQTT Updates

The *subscriber.py* script is provided as a verification script that acts the same as a device. It can be used to verify that the Publisher is working as expected. Ensure that the `BROKER_ADDRESS` matches the Broker used in *publisher.py*.

Using the publisher script for verifying the Broker connection:

```
cd libs/ota-update/scripts
python subscriber.py [tls] [-l] [-b broker] [-k kit] [-f filepath] [-c <chunk_size>] [-e <company_topic>]
```

Usage:

- `tls` - Add this argument to run the Publisher with TLS (secure sockets). You must also supply appropriate certificates and keys.

- `-l` - Output more logging information to debug connection issues.

- `-b <broker>` - Use this argument to override the default Broker. Note that you will need to add certificates for TLS usage. The files need to reside in the same directory as *publisher.py*.

  - `amazon`

    - Change the `AMAZON_BROKER_ADDRESS` endpoint in the *subscriber.py* script.

      ```
      AMAZON_BROKER_ADDRESS = "<endpoint>.iot.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"
      ```

    - Add the following certificate files:

      ```
      ca_certs = "amazon_ca.crt"
      certfile = "amazon_client.crt"
      keyfile  = "amazon_private_key.pem"
      ```

  - `eclipse`  (Broker: `mqtt.eclipseprojects.io`)

    - Add the following certificate files:
      ```
      ca_certs = "eclipse_ca.crt"
      certfile = "eclipse_client.crt"
      keyfile  = "eclipse_client.pem"
      ```

  - `mosquitto`  (Broker: `test.mosquitto.org`)

    - Add the following certificate files:

      ```
      ca_certs = "mosquitto.org.crt"
      certfile = "mosquitto_client.crt"
      keyfile  = "mosquitto_client.key"
      ```

- `-k kit` - Use this argument to override the default kit (CY8CPROTO_062_4343W).

  The kit name is used as part of the topic name; it must match the kit you are using, be sure to replace '-' (dash) with '_' (underscore).

- `-f filepath` - Use this argument to designate the output file for download.

- `-c <chunk_size>` - The size in bytes of the chunk to request (used for testing).

- `-e <company_topic>` - Add this to the first part of the topic path names.

  Company topic default is "OTAUpdate".

  This must also be mirrored in the application for the topic name. This allows for multiple devices being tested to simultaneously connect to different instances of the Publisher running on different systems so that they do not interfere with each other.

## 15. Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## 16. Software Setup

1. Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

2. Python Interpreter. The supplied *publisher.py* script is tested with [Python 3.8.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/).

## 17. Enabling Debug Output

The *cy_log* facility is used to enable more levels of logging. To use the logging features, you need to call the initialization function. After that, you can adjust the level of logging for various "facilities".

At the minimum, you can initialize the logging system by including the header file, and calling the initialization function with a logging level. The other arguments are for callbacks to allow the application to handle the actual output (this enables you to log to an alternate destination), and provide a time stamp. See the *cy_log.h* file for the log levels. For OTA logging, use the `CYLF_OTA` facility.

```
#include "cy_log.h"

   cy_log_init(CY_LOG_WARNING, NULL, NULL);
```

## 18. Prepare for Building Your OTA Application

Copy *\<ota-update-library\>/configs/cy_ota_config.h* to your application's top-level directory, and adjust for your application needs.

   ```
   cp \<ota-update-library\>/configs/cy_ota_config.h <application dir>
   ```

Also, a reminder to look at configuration files for other libraries.

## 19. Limitations

1. If not using a Job document with MQTT, and the device is not subscribed to the topic on the MQTT Broker when the Publisher sends the update, it will miss the update.

  As the workaround, use a Job document, which has information about where the OTA update image is located.

2. Internal and external flash is supported. You can use the internal flash only in certain combinations with platforms that have 2M of internal flash. The size of the application is greatly limited if using internal flash only.

3. Ensure that you have a reliable network connection before starting an OTA update. If your network connection is poor, OTA update may fail due to lost packets or a lost connection.

4. Ensure that you have a fully charged device before starting an OTA update. If your device's battery is low, OTA may fail.

5. When using the ARM compiler with the CYW20829 or BLE platforms, ensure that MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT is not defined in mbedtls_user_config.h. When MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT is defined it is possible to encounter an unresolved symbol error during the link phase when using the ARM compiler.
